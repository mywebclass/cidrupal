Contributing to Web Consumer Manager
=========================

Thanks for working with our software! We love any help we can get to build a good system. We just have a few guidelines:

1. Make sure the bugs are Web Consumer CORE specific! Any bugs related to specific modules should go to their specific repository! So any LinkedIn-specific modules would go to <https://github.com/mywebclass/wconsumer_linkedIn/issues>.

2. Syntax Test your files! We're going to be adding unit testing as well but for now, syntax testing will do.

3. Fork it and then submit a pull request!
